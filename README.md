# SESNtemple

This repository contains data products from [Liu & Modjaz (2014)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1405.1437L), [Liu et al. (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151008049L), and [Modjaz et al. (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150907124M) on Stripped Envelope SNe (SESN), ie SNe of types IIb, Ib, Ic and Ic-bl. There are two different types of SN templates we produced and used in our research, which are stored in two different folders:
- <b>/MeanSpec</b> contains all mean spectra and standard deviation spectra of different SESN types in [Liu et al. (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151008049L), and [Modjaz et al. (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150907124M), including those not shown in plots. Mean-spectra and standard deviation spectra can be used to quantify SN diversity, determine if a new transient is a novel type of explosion, and so on. See the README file in the folder for details of the mean-spectra. Mean spectra of SNe Ic are used as SN Ic templates for our template fitting code called "Ic_conv_Icbl_MCMC.py" (https://github.com/nyusngroup/SESNspectraLib), which measures line velocities in SNe Ic-bl based on blended lines. They live under the SESNspectraLib repository, since we want the template fitting code to be self-contained, and since those mean spectra templates were constructed from SN Ic spectra using slightly different phase ranges than the ones released here.
 
- <b>/SNIDtemplates</b> contains all SuperNova IDentification (SNID; [Blondin & Tonry 2007](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...666.1024B)) templates that were initially released in [Liu & Modjaz (2014)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1405.1437L) based on CfA spectra, as well as additional templates that were newly created and used in [Liu et al. (2016, for IIb and Ib)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151008049L) and in [Modjaz et al. (2016, for Ic and Ic-bl)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150907124M), based on literature spectra. Adding these templates to the spectra library database of SNID will increase the number of SESN templates in the database, which will help SN classification via SNID. See the README file in the folder for details of SN spectra that are used to construct SNID templates.
