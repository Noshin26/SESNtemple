# SESNtemple

This repository contains data products in [Liu & Modjaz (2014)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1437), [Liu et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08049), and [Modjaz et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07124). 

- Folder <b>AverageSpec</b> contains all average spectra and standard deviation spectra in [Liu et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08049), and [Modjaz et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07124). Average spectra and standard deviation spectra can be used to quantify SN diversity, determine if a new transient is a novel type of explosion, and so on. See the README file in the folder for details of average spectra.
- Folder <b>SNIDtemplates</b> contains all SuperNova IDentification (SNID; [Blondin & Tonry 2007](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4488)) templates in [Liu & Modjaz (2014)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1437), [Liu et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08049), and [Modjaz et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07124). Adding these templates to the database of SNID will increase the number of SN Ib/c templates in the database, which will help SN classification via SNID. See the README file in the folder for details of spectra that are used to construct SNID templates.
- Folder <b>TempleSpec_for_Ic_conv_Icbl_MCMC</b> contains SN Ic average spectra (or templates) used for [Ic_conv_Icbl_MCMC.py](https://github.com/nyusngroup/SESNspectraLib), a Python module to measure the absorption velocity of SN Ic-bl from the Fe II 5169 spectral feature in [Modjaz et al. (2016)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07124). See the README file in the folder <b>AverageSpec</b> for details of average spectra.
