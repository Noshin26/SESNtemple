### SNIDtemplates 
This release contains all SuperNova IDentification (SNID; [Blondin & Tonry 2007](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4488)) templates of Stripped-Envelope SN (i.e., SNe IIb, Ib, Ic and Ic-bl) spectra presented/included in [Liu & Modjaz 2014] (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1405.1437L), [Liu et al. 2016] (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151008049L), and [Modjaz et al. 2016] (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150907124M), based on both CfA Data (initially released in Liu & Modjaz 2014) and the rest of literature data (included in Liu et al. 2016 for IIb and Ib, Modjaz et al. 2016 for Ic and Ic-bl). Adding these templates to the default library of SESN spectra of SNID (https://people.lam.fr/blondin.stephane/software/snid/) will increase the number of Stripped-Envelope templates in the database, which in turn will help SN classification via SNID. 

The text file "SNIDtemplate-SESNe-info.txt" includes detailed information about the SNe and their spectra that were used to construct the templates:
- its subtype
- redshift (which was used to de-redshift the spectra) 
- the date of maxium light, according to which the spectra are referenced for their phase, though the release also contains spectra of SNe without maximum light measurements (see info).

###we are using SNID-5.0.

###add new subtype: Ibn.
###there are 465 spectra of 36 SNe Ib/c in templates-2.0.
###there are 403 spectral templates out of 44 SNe Ib (including 1 SN that is already in templates-2.0) and 341 out of 39 SNe Ic (including 2 SNe that is already in templates-2.0) in this templates.
