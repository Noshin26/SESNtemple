This directory contains moving weighted average velocities of Fe II 5169 for SLSNe, SNe Ic-bl and SNe Ic, as computed in [Liu, Modjaz & Bianco (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv161207321L) and shown in our Figure 1. The moving weighted average velocities are smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 5 days. The weights are taken to be the inverse of the square of the errors of individual measurements. 

#### Key Words/Outputs :
- PHASE_ARR: phase array in days

- SIGMAM_ARR: weighted standard deviation of average velocity in km/s
- SIGMAD_ARR: weighted standard deviation of the data points in km/s
- NUM_SN: No. of SNe contributing to weighted average velocity at the corresponding phase
- STEP: moving step size in days
