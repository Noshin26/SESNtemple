The average spectra are constructed using code in 

Name convention:
meanspec + type + spectra inclusion method + phase + smooth method
- type: Ib (SN Ib), Ic (SN Ic), Icbroad (SN Ic-bl), Icbroad_nogrb (SN Ic-bl without GRB), Icbroad_withgrb (SN Ic-bl with GRB, or SN-GRB), cosmsngrb (high luminosity SN-GRB), llsngrb (low luminosity SN-GRB)
- spectra inclusion method: presence of "1specperSN" means only 1 spectrum per SN is included in an average spectrum, while absence of "1specperSN" means all spectra within the required phase range are included in the average spectra.
- phase: with respect to date of V band maximum light
- smooth method: presence of "ft" means spectra are smoothed using FFT method in
